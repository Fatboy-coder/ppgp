# Portable Persistent Goal Protocol (PPGP)

> Portable continuity protocol for long-running coding agents.

**Status:** Experimental v0.1.2  
**First public release:** 2026-08-24  
**Current release:** 2026-08-26  
**License:** MIT  
**Maturity:** Provisional

PPGP is an open, vendor-neutral continuity protocol for long-running AI coding agents and agentic software workflows. It keeps active software goals recoverable across context compaction, interrupted sessions, agent replacement and different coding-agent products.

It does not replace model memory, Git, tests, MCP or provider-specific compaction. It defines a small control protocol around them.

## Try PPGP in 30 seconds

Inside any Git repository:

```bash
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp init
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp goal "Ship one verified milestone"
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp status
```

PPGP keeps the active goal, verified state, frozen decisions, blockers and next executable action recoverable in repository-visible state so a fresh coding agent can resume with less human reconstruction.

For a quick environment check:

```bash
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp doctor
```

## What PPGP keeps recoverable

A coding agent should be able to recover the minimum operational state needed to continue useful work:

- the current goal;
- frozen decisions;
- verified state;
- remaining work;
- real blockers;
- durable lessons;
- the next executable action.

## Why

Long-running coding agents commonly lose efficiency when they must repeatedly reconstruct operational context after context compaction, interrupted sessions, handoffs or agent replacement.

PPGP externalizes only the minimum useful state and treats conversation history as disposable cache.

## Core model

```text
GOAL
  |
  v
THINK -> FREEZE -> EXECUTE -> HARDEN -> SHIP -> DISTILL -> CLOSED
                     ^                    |
                     |                    v
              RETRIEVE -> ACT -> VERIFY -> DELTA
```

Logical memory layers:

```text
CONSTITUTION   long-lived authority and constraints
ROADMAP        project direction and goal scheduling
MEMORY         durable decisions, invariants and lessons
ACTIVE_GOAL    temporary working memory for one goal
GIT            forensic history and implementation evidence
```

`ACTIVE_GOAL` is temporary. At goal closure, durable information is distilled into persistent memory and the temporary goal state is deleted.

## Design principles

- Retrieve relevant memory instead of preloading the whole history.
- Prefer current verified state over chronological diaries.
- Communicate deltas instead of repeating full summaries.
- Treat tests and production evidence as stronger than agent confidence.
- Keep human escalation for genuine authority boundaries.
- Use additional agents only when expected information gain exceeds coordination cost.
- Keep the protocol readable by humans and portable between model vendors.
- Do not require vector databases, embeddings, MCP, a specific model or a specific IDE.

## Install

PPGP v0.1.2 ships as an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) compatible skill, as a dependency-free Node.js CLI published on npm, and through thin native distribution adapters for major coding-agent ecosystems.

### Universal Agent Skills route

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Fatboy-coder/ppgp/tree/main/skills/ppgp
```

`skills/ppgp/` is the canonical PPGP Agent Skill source.

### Native platform routes

| Platform | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Plugins → Add marketplace → `Fatboy-coder/ppgp` → install `ppgp` |
| OpenAI Codex | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` + repo marketplace metadata |
| ChatGPT | Agent Skill / skill-only OpenAI plugin; public directory listing requires external publication |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini extensions install https://github.com/Fatboy-coder/ppgp --auto-update` |
| Cursor | root Agent Plugin `plugin.json` + canonical `skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | repository-native `.agents/skills/ppgp/` discovery |
| Windsurf | repository-native `.agents/skills/ppgp/` discovery |
| Devin | repository-native `.agents/skills/ppgp/` discovery |
| Kiro / Cline / Junie | import the canonical public Agent Skill |

See [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](./COMPATIBILITY.md) for verification level, limitations and remaining marketplace actions. Repository readiness is not presented as vendor approval or public listing.

### PPGP CLI

The canonical public npm package is `@fatboy-coder/ppgp`:

```bash
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp init
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp doctor
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp goal "Ship the next verified milestone"
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp status
npx @fatboy-coder/ppgp handoff
```

For repeated use, install it globally and keep the short `ppgp` executable:

```bash
npm install -g @fatboy-coder/ppgp
ppgp init
```

The CLI is deliberately deterministic. It helps inspect, scaffold and recover repository-visible state without pretending to replace agent reasoning, verification, distillation or closure checks.

### Manual install

Download the current release archive from [`ppgp-v0.1.2.zip`](https://github.com/Fatboy-coder/ppgp/releases/latest/download/ppgp-v0.1.2.zip), extract it, then copy or upload the `ppgp` skill directory into a client that implements the Agent Skills standard.

The repository also keeps the canonical source under [`skills/ppgp/`](./skills/ppgp/) for inspection and development.

For clients that natively discover `.agents/skills/`, PPGP commits a generated compatibility mirror at `.agents/skills/ppgp/`. Automated tests enforce byte-for-byte parity with the canonical skill.

### Read without installing

Read [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the protocol itself.

The skill contains a compact operational reference in [`skills/ppgp/references/PPGP.md`](./skills/ppgp/references/PPGP.md).

## Operations

The Agent Skill exposes six workflow intents:

```text
ppgp init
ppgp goal
ppgp status
ppgp handoff
ppgp distill
ppgp close
```

The CLI currently implements deterministic helpers for `init`, `doctor`, `goal`, `status`, `handoff`, `skill-path`, and `install-skill`. `distill` and `close` remain agent-performed protocol operations: they require judgement about what is durable and whether the Definition of Done is verified, which a deterministic helper cannot supply.

The CLI resolves the repository root from `--root`, else the Git top-level of the working directory, else the working directory. It reads ACTIVE_GOAL fields written as `## GOAL` headers (any level), `**GOAL**` bold lines or `GOAL:` key lines, reports unrecognized sections instead of dropping them, and exits `0` for valid state, `2` when GOAL or NEXT_EXECUTABLE_ACTION cannot be found, and `1` for malformed or missing state. `doctor` reports the current branch and working-tree state and, when no ACTIVE_GOAL is checked out, lists other refs that carry one without switching branches. `goal --force` preserves the previous file as a timestamped `.bak`.

These are protocol operations, not assumptions about a vendor-specific slash-command system.

## Distribution

PPGP uses multiple distribution surfaces on purpose:

```text
Canonical Agent Skill      -> vendor-neutral source of truth
Claude Plugin/Marketplace  -> native Claude discovery
OpenAI Plugin              -> Codex / OpenAI plugin packaging
Gemini Extension           -> Gemini CLI installation
Agent Plugin               -> Cursor and compatible clients
.agents/skills mirror      -> Copilot / Windsurf / Devin discovery
GitHub Release             -> direct download
npmjs.com                  -> public CLI discovery and zero-install execution
GitHub Packages            -> package presence inside GitHub
```

The canonical npm package name is `@fatboy-coder/ppgp`.

Platform adapters do not fork PPGP semantics. Current release metadata is kept on the same semantic version across the specification, CLI package, citation metadata and versioned adapters.

See [`DISTRIBUTION.md`](./DISTRIBUTION.md) for package names, manifests, version mapping and publication security.

## Research and evaluation

PPGP is experimental.

Independent evaluation, replication, criticism, alternative implementations and failure reports are welcome.

If you evaluate PPGP in research, production or comparative agent testing, identify the exact PPGP version used and publish enough methodology for the result to be independently interpreted.

The reproducible evaluation guide is in [`EVALUATION.md`](./EVALUATION.md). The repository also provides structured issue forms for recovery failures and evaluation reports.

Especially useful evidence includes:

- whether a fresh agent can recover an active goal without human reconstruction;
- recovery failures and ambiguous state;
- documentation overhead created by the protocol;
- unnecessary human escalations;
- stale or contradictory memory;
- cross-agent or cross-provider incompatibilities;
- smaller representations that preserve recovery quality;
- measured results from small, large, legacy or multi-agent repositories.

Negative results are useful. PPGP should change when reproducible evidence shows that a simpler or more reliable rule exists.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Citation

Citation metadata is provided in [`CITATION.cff`](./CITATION.cff).

Version-specific citation is strongly preferred. The public GitHub handle is used as the author identifier until real-name citation metadata is added.

## What v0.1.2 deliberately does not claim

PPGP v0.1.2 does **not** claim to:

- invent persistent agent memory;
- outperform existing memory systems;
- be optimal for every repository;
- reduce tokens by a specific percentage;
- eliminate human review;
- make multi-agent systems inherently better.

The purpose of the public v0.1.2 release is to make the protocol inspectable, reproducible and falsifiable.

## Project mission

PPGP is a community-oriented open-source project intended to help developers and users get more reliable work from coding agents with less repeated explanation and avoidable supervision.

The project may be used commercially under the MIT license. The community-oriented mission is not a restriction on who may use the protocol.

## Publication history

PPGP v0.1 was first published publicly on 2026-08-24 in the `Fatboy-coder/fatboy-coder` repository under `/ppgp`.

The current release is PPGP v0.1.2. This repository is now the canonical home of the protocol. The original Git history remains the first public record of the initial v0.1 release.

## Versioning

PPGP uses semantic versions for the current protocol and its versioned distribution artifacts.

`0.x` releases are experimental and may change incompatibly.

Researchers, developers and maintainers should cite the exact version evaluated.
